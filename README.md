This repository contains the manuscript files, the codebase, and the figures for our manuscript "Characterization of human lightness discrimination thresholds for independent spectral variations" https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.16.545355.

In this project, we characterized human lightness discrimination thresholds for three types of spectral variations in the visual scene. For this, we show two computer generated images on calibrated color monitors to human subjects and asked them to discriminate the images based on the lightness of the spherical object at the center of the image (See figure below). From trial to trial, we changed the properties of the scenes, such as the color of objects in the background and the intensity of light in the scene.

We measured the dependence of the discrimination thresholds on the amount of variation in the scene properties. The type of variation we studies included change in color of background objects for chromatic and achromatic backgrounds, change in intensity of light sources, and simultaneous change in background color and light intensity.

Our results show that human visual system works close to the limits imposed by the intrisic variation in the visual system. Additionally, our results also indicate that the effect of independent sources of variation combines linearly under simultaneous variation.
